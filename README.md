Official implementation of the ICME 2025 paper "Slot Inversion for Asymmetric Composed Image Retrieval"[Paper](https://www.computer.org/csdl/proceedings-article/icme/2025/11209393/2beCcT9a6Hu)

## Highlights
Composed Image Retrieval (CIR) is a challenging vision-language task that retrieves target images using multimodal (image+text) queries. With the emergence of large-scale vision-language (VL) models, conventional CIR approaches have achieved remarkable breakthroughs, yet their deployment in resource-constrained environments remains challenging. To address this issue, we propose a novel framework, Slot Inversion for Asymmetric Composed Image Retrieval (Slot4ACir), which adopts an asymmetric setting: lightweight models are employed on the query side, while large vision-language models are deployed on the gallery side. In this framework, we propose a lightweight inversion module based on slot attention, which maps an image into multiple textual tokens with distinct semantics. Additionally, the LLM sampler and the distillation alignment (DTA) loss are introduced to facilitate richer semantic interactions and the extraction of more informative representations, respectively. Extensive experiments on two popular benchmarks demonstrate the effectiveness of our approach.
